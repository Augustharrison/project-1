# CIT 281 Project 1

## Learning Objectives

- Basic Unix Shell commands
  In the 21st century, every business– from fashion to finance– is a
  tech company. Every company has a web presence, and many have
  smart phone apps. Coding and web dev, therefore, are high-demand
  skills for every job, and differentiate you from most people in the job
  market. All employers rank STEM skills very highly.
  By completing this project you will practice the following skills:
  • Basic Unix Shell commands
  • Install and Configure Git using the Unix Shell
  • Basic Git Commands (add, commit, push, clone)
  • Github overview
  • Markdown language for README files
  • JavaScript ES6+ features

I learned how useful it is to use a shell instead of making folders on my own
